# Massive Co-Op Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple implementation of a multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe. Players are randomly assigned to a team (O or X) and during their turn they vote for a move. The move with the most votes is automatically made at the end of the round. If no votes are casted then a random move is made. After casting a vote or when it's opponents' turn players can see vote counts for each move in real time.

To test the game for multiple players you can open the game in multiple tabs.
